# Rock-Paper-Scissors
First, I defined the user choices in a single function and the computer choices in a seperate function. 

Then, I merged both functions into a determine winner to figure out who wins the game.

Finally, I created a function called playgame() to randomly select between rock, paper, or scissors to determine who wins.
